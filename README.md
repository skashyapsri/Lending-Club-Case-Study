## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
    Upon receiving a loan application, a company is required to evaluate the applicant's profile in order to make an informed decision regarding loan approval. The bank's decision is influenced by two distinct risks:
    - Failing to approve the loan for an applicant who is capable of repayment will result in a loss of business for the company.
    - Approving the loan for an applicant who is unlikely to repay, thus defaulting on the loan, may cause a financial loss for the company.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    The primary aim is to identify the key determinants of loan defaults, which will provide valuable insights for portfolio management and risk assessment. It is imperative for the company to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to loan defaults.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
Complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011

## Conclusions
Based on the examination, it can be inferred that the following factors significantly influence the likelihood of loan defaults:
1. Categorization of annual income
2. Loan term
3. Loan grade
4. Loan purpose

Furthermore, the study suggests that the lending company should strive to maintain a balanced distribution of loan grades within its portfolio. While Grade A loans are less risky, the company cannot solely rely on them since they yield lower interest rates. On the other hand, Grade G loans have higher interest rates but are more prone to default. Thus, a balance between these loan grades is recommended.
